Microtasks for GSOC Idea: [Boosting data processing in GrimoireLab](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab/issues/285).

Here is my [proposal]().

---

## Microtask 1

- [x] **Task**: Set up Perceval to be executed from PyCharm.

- Explanation can be found [here](./microtask-1).


## Microtask 2

- [x] **Task**: Create a Python script to execute Perceval via its Python interface using the Git and GitHub backends. Feel free to select any target repository.

- Explanation can be found [here](./microtask-2).

## Microtask 3

- [x] **Task**:Based on the JSON documents produced by Perceval and its source code, try to answer the following questions:
  - What is the meaning of the JSON attribute timestamp?
  - What is the meaning of the JSON attribute updated_on?
  - What is the meaning of the JSON attribute origin?
  - What is the meaning of the JSON attribute category?
  - How many categories do the Git and GitHub backends have?
  - What is the meaning of the JSON attribute uuid?
  - What is the meaning of the JSON attribute search_fields?
  - What is stored in the attribute data of each JSON document produced by Perceval?
  - Identify the code in charge of dealing with remote APIs and explain its logic.
  - Which is the folder that stores the archives generated by Perceval?

- Answers to the above questions can be found [here](./microtask-3).
